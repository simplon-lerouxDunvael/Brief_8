### **Scrum quotidien**

Scrum Master = Me, myself and I
Daily personnal reactions with reports and designations of first tasks for the day.

Frequent meeting with other coworkers to study solutions to encountered problems together.

<div id='RG'/>  

### **Creation of a resource group**

I tried to create a resource group with a lock with a Bicep script I created. When I tried to deploy it, I had an error message telling me that I did not have the rights to deploy this script on Simplon's subscription.

![cant_deploy_bicep2sub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221535360-df4fdccf-f457-435c-b581-9bfca9be9582.png)

So, I decided to do it via a script .sh.

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Storacc'/>  

### **Creation of a forked branch in GitHub**

As required in the brief, I forked Alfred's [azure-vote](https://github.com/simplon-alfred/azure-voting-app-redis) repos and renamed it as [Forked_azVotingApp_b8duna](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Forked_azVotingApp_b8duna) to avoid confusion.

![forked_branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221544580-67de67d0-c302-4a69-a55f-f1fedfb8d8a0.png)


[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='AKS'/>  

### **Creation of the AKS Cluster (with SSH keys generated)**

As Kubernetes is totally capable of handling it by itself and more reliably than human hand (with the right settings), I did not create a storage Account, PV creations and bindings.

I created my AKS cluster :

```bash
az aks create -g b8duna -n AKSClusterDuna --enable-managed-identity --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --enable-msi-auth-for-monitoring  --generate-ssh-keys
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Connecting'/>  

### **Connecting the AKS Cluster and Azure**

Then I connected my AKS cluster to Azure.

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group b8duna --name AKSClusterDuna
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='RedSecret'/>  

### **Issues**

I deployed the azure voting app correctly but had issues once again with ingress and the TLS.
As Quentin, Luna and I, all had the same problems, we realized several tests while streaming our screens.

We tried and discussed our results and failures and finally came to terms.

We found that we needed to :

* create the two namespaces after connecting the AKS cluster to Azure
* create a redis secret for each namespace
* create a helm repository and add nginx to it
* install nginx in each namespace (qua and prod)
* leave some time to nginx to initialize and gets its IP address
* extract the external ip address of the nginx (still in load balancer)
* create a dns record A with nginx external ip address (one for each environment)
* create and add a Hetstack Helm repository to then install cert-manager in the cert-manager namespace
* install cert-manager webhook gandi in the cert-manager namespace
* deploy the voting app in each namespace
* deploy ingress version 1 in each namespace
* deploy let's encrypt issuer configuration files in each namespace
* create a gandi-credentials secret for each namespace (with the dns API token)
* deploy the certificate TLS for each namespace
* finally deploy ingress version 2 in each namespace

After deploying every resource in this order, we could all connect to the voting app from the https urls we chose (for both namespaces).

After all these steps, we decided (with Luna) to create a script that would deploy everything directly without having to redo the steps manually every time our resource groups get destroyed.

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='DevOps'/>  

### **Connecting to Azure DevOps Pipelines**

First I went to Azure DevOps, created a project and clicked on Pipelines : <https://dev.azure.com/dlerouxext/b8duna> 

Then, I had to configure my organization and project's [visibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/make-project-public?view=azure-devops). I went to the settings and turned on the visibility to public.

Since the last update of Kubernetes, the connection to Azure can't be made with the service connections.  
Therefore, I had to create a kubeconfig file that recovers several connections informations.

```Bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $rgname --name $aksname -f kubeconfig.yaml
```

then I had to download it and place it directly in my Git repository (downloading it from azure terminal does not push it into Git):

```Bash
download kubeconfig.yaml
```

Once downloaded, I just have to put the code into the pipeline :

![kubeconfig_pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/222142716-c7971b42-d8ea-4116-b7b2-134ea79157da.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Ingress'/>  

### **Deployment of Ingress**

Once I deployed redis and the azure voting app and checked that my pods were running properly I decided to install Ingress to be able to access to the voting app from an url http I chose (and that i would later link to my dns record).

First I installed everything that was necessary for ingress with the following command :

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

Then I created three different versions of Ingress.

* ingress_step1.yaml file  : the TLS parts, the host and the TLS annotations are commented. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

![first_ingress_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221797099-15cb98e4-40ef-4fa2-b95b-b41ffc3f1d12.png)

After this step, ingress had an IP address. Then I created a "A" DNS record with the ingress IP address. I checked ingress and it now displayed with : smoothie.simplon-duna.space.

* ingress_step2.yaml file  : i added the dns to the host part. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.
* ingress_step3.yaml file  : the TLS parts and the TLS annotations are decommented and the host has its dns name added. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

Finally I connected to the Voting app using smoothie.simplon-duna.space and it worked.

[&#8679;](#top)








Finally, I added a service connection and checked "Use cluster admin credentials" (Project settings > service connections > add > kubernetes).

![service_connection2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210520992-0536c68a-17b6-4b8a-91e4-2bccb2159e75.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Pipeline'/>  

### **Creation of a test pipeline**

I created a new pipeline and provided its location (Github.yaml) and the repository (Brief_8). Then I chose a starter template and used the assistant to add a Kubectl task.  
Finally I saved it and ran it.

![pipeline_job_run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210521068-ec3cc98c-e2ab-46a7-9d46-3cadd39a3c37.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Checks'/>  

### **Checks and tests**

In order to understand how the pipeline works and the path used on the pipeline's environment vm, I used the commands ```pwd``` and ```ls -la``` on my pipeline script :

![pipeline_job_run2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210543908-3f4670ec-8fdb-444f-acb7-e728a63d2d48.png)

It allowed me to know which path I needed to put to refer the .yaml file to use in the pipeline.

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Error'/>  

### ****


[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Solution'/>  

### ****



To understand the errors I had I checked the events :

```bash
kubectl get events
```

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
```

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp' -w
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Scrum'/>  

### **Updating the voting app on the script**

I changed the previous version of the voting app with the new one : simplonasa/azure_voting_app:v1.0.11 and my container for the Voting app was successfully created.
It then displayed in CrashLoopBackOff because redis was not created but now I just needed to find a solution for redis and the PV/PVC for everything to work properly.

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Updating'/>  

### ****



Then I check my pods and services :
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

As everything was running perfectly, I used the IP address to connect to the Voting App. It worked fine. Then I deleted the redis pod ```kubectl delete pod redis-service``` and typed ```kubectl get pods```. The redis service was automatically renewed.  
Finally, I refreshed the voting app page and found out that the votes count had not been reset. All the containers were working and the persistent volume as well.

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Ingress'/>  

### **Add Ingress**

As the scheduling was working, I decided to install Ingress to be able to access to the voting app from an url http I chose (and that i would later link to my dns record).  

I removed the Load balancer in my azure-vote.yaml file in order to put ClusterIP so that ingress can provide an IP address to use for my DNS record.  

![clusterIP_for_ingress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210793328-a1052a6d-c03c-4dc7-bc24-0331170b7aac.png)

![no_tls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210793423-5cf4b0af-93ea-4a51-b412-6439adef0f04.png)

I removed the TLS parts, the host and the TLS annotations in my ingress.yaml file. Then I applied it ```kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

But I had no IP address. So I installed everything that was necessary for ingress with the following command :

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

After this step, ingress finally had an IP address. Then I created a "A" DNS record with the ingress IP address. I checked ingress and it now displayed with : smoothie.simplon-duna.space.
Finally I connected to the Voting app using smoothie.simplon-duna.space and it worked.

![dns_records](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210812132-630cc498-504f-4b29-b725-66d8f442ef4f.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Cert-manager'/>  

### **Install Cert-manager and Jetstack (for gandi)**

[Jetstack](https://github.com/bwolf/cert-manager-webhook-gandi)

Since my ingress was working and i could connect in http to my voting app, I installed Jetstack and created a repository.

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

Then, I installed my cert-manager to configure my certificate ([To check cert-manager last version to install](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/supported-releases/)).

```bash
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true --version v1.10.1 --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}'
```

<img width="1820" alt="Cert_manager" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210761309-393e496c-ff14-41e2-b02a-7b65fb7baeb7.png">

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Gsecret'/>  

### **Creation of a Gandi secret**

After cert-manager was installed, i created a secret for Gandi with the token from my gandi dns.  
*To check the token > settings from account > account and security > security.*

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gandi-credentials --from-literal=api-token='[API-TOKEN]'
```

The gandi secret was created in the default namespace because it needs to be accessed in the same namespace as the issuer (which is in the default namespace).

![gandi-secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210763575-22af59d1-812b-43fa-9017-9b9ff20b7b15.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Webhook'/>  

### **Install cert-manager webhook for gandi**

Then i installed cert-manager-webhook for gandi so that the certificate could be linked to my DNS. I put the webhook for gandi in the cert-manager namespace because cert-manager was installed in the cert-manager namespace.

```bash
helm install cert-manager-webhook-gandi --repo https://bwolf.github.io/cert-manager-webhook-gandi --version v0.2.0 --namespace cert-manager --set features.apiPriorityAndFairness=true  --set logLevel=6 --generate-name
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Binding'/>  

### **Creation of secret role and binding for webhook**

I gave role access and created a rolebinding for the webhook (to bind gandi and the cert-manager).

```bash
kubectl create role access-secret --verb=get,list,watch,update,create --resource=secrets
```

Then i copied the webhook number from the cert-manager namespace with :

```Bash
kubectl get secrets -n cert-manager
```

![webhook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210821499-2c9231b6-05a8-4a2a-964b-11c8792a9dbd.png)

And pasted it on the following command :

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding --role=access-secret default-to-secrets --serviceaccount=cert-manager:cert-manager-webhook-gandi-3260173208
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Certificate'/>  

### **Check the certificate**

Then i checked the status of my certificate with several commands :

```Bash
kubectl get certificate
```

```Bash
kubectl get orders
```

```Bash
kubectl describe orders
```

```Bash
kubectl describe challenges
```

![get_certificate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210973322-b97c4836-8856-4fa1-9beb-ffb6182ff4a0.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Scheduling'/>  

### **Scheduling**

[Scheduling a pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

In order to update the Voting app with its last version, I scheduled the pipeline so it would ran every hour on the hour.

![scheduling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210753304-56bbd627-4139-4193-8afa-b20696251a79.png)

Then I verified that the pipeline job was a success.

![scheduling_pipeline_success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210757983-4f4958a2-c718-46ec-9083-f622e9f4483f.png)

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Debugging'/>  

### **Pipeline debugging**

I found that I had issues with my pipeline that did not update the app version even though it was running. I added some commands to update the Kubenertes secret but the cmd line's job was failing. The commands were not read.

Then I relaunched the pipeline and got an error message saying that `the filename could not be found`. After several checks it seemed to be a credential issue. I proceeded in two steps :

- First I redid the pipeline and service connections (Kubernetes and Github) in order to get new (fresh) tokens but it did not solve the issue
- Then I added a task to get Kubernetes credentials but once again, it did not solve the issue

I started different checks and tried to point at which command, specifically, the issue happened. So I added `set -x` (that shows the process for every commands). It highlighted that there were quotation marks on the app version on the variable I had created (kubernetes secret).
I could also have used `set -e` that stops at the first error during the cmd process.

In order to remove the quotation marks from the voting app version from the VERVAR variable I created, I added  `| sed 's/"//g; s/}//g')` to the command : the quotation marks were removed from the get secret output for the variable VERCUR.

Then i added `|awk -F ':' '{print $2}'` in order to cut the output from the command and only get the second part of the secret (*{"version":"djEuMC4xMw=="}*). This gave me the following command to get the secret second part without the quotation marks and closing bracket :

``` Bash
VERCUR=$(kubectl get secret version-secret -o jsonpath='{.data}'|awk -F ':' '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//g; s/}//g')
```

Then as the secret was encoded, I used the following Bash command to decode it :

``` Bash
VERCUR=$(echo "$VAR1" | base64 -d)
```

Then I checked the result with `echo` and I had the app version display in clear without the quotation marks for the Kubenertes secret and for the curl which I then could compare. To sum up : I now have the current version, the secret version of the app and the potential difference between the two, allowing me to automatize to update (or not) the secret and the pod.

![pipeline_working_for_real](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/216048585-9b9ae17d-b395-49e8-bd40-e65fc8c426ae.png)

_I could have also used a different way to remove the quotations marks from the variable and secret. This regex `s/^\"(.*)\"$/\1/` allows me to remove the quotation marks at the beginning and the end, but most importantly, keep 'safe' a group of characters that could contains quotation marks as well (for example a password). In this brief it is not a problem but in other situations it could become one._  
_In conclusion, as it was Alfred who created this regex to show me how he would have done it and explained it to me, I did not put it in the brief and kept my solution, but I will use it in the future. As the secret is in json has a closing bracket, I could not use this solution (but I could have use it for the curl)._

<div id='Summary'/>  

### **How to get a certificate Summary**

First, apply Ingress' prerequisites and Ingress without the hosts nor TLS (DO NOT DELETE, only comment).

Then, prepare Gandi with the IP adress from Ingress. Then create the gandi secret.

Then, resettle the Host and TLS in Ingress ***DO NOT DELETE***, reapply the file. Then, install the webhook and give role access and rolebinding.

Finally, apply the Issuer yaml file and ONLY THEN, apply the certificate file (certif-space-com.yaml).

[ingress.yaml](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Brief_7/blob/main/Infra_K8s/ingress.yaml) -> [issuer.yaml](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Brief_7/blob/main/Infra_K8s/issuer.yaml) -> [certif-space-com.yaml](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Brief_7/blob/main/Infra_K8s/certif-space-com.yaml)

### **Check consumption**

I tried to check the consumption for the infrastructure deployed and tests I realized, but it seems that I do not have the rights on the subscription.

```Bash
az consumption usage list --subscription a1f74e2d-ec58-4f9a-a112-088e3469febb
```

So I decided to use the Azure Calculator in order to check the consumption of this brief's resources.  

I calculated costs on several paying plans :

- [Monthly (for 12 months)](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Brief_7/blob/main/Docs/Costs_forecast_monthly.xlsx)

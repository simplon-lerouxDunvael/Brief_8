### **Scrum quotidien**

Scrum Master = Me, myself and I
Daily personnal reactions with reports and designations of first tasks for the day.

Frequent meeting with other coworkers to study solutions to encountered problems together.

<div id='RG'/>  

### **Creation of a resource group**

I tried to create a resource group with a lock with a Bicep script I created. When I tried to deploy it, I had an error message telling me that I did not have the rights to deploy this script on Simplon's subscription.

![cant_deploy_bicep2sub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221535360-df4fdccf-f457-435c-b581-9bfca9be9582.png)

So, I decided to do it via a script .sh.

<div id='Storacc'/>  

### **Creation of a forked branch in GitHub**

As required in the brief, I forked Alfred's [azure-vote](https://github.com/simplon-alfred/azure-voting-app-redis) repos and renamed it as [Forked_azVotingApp_b8duna](https://github.com/simplon-lerouxDunvael/Forked_azVotingApp_b8duna) to avoid confusion.

![forked_branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221544580-67de67d0-c302-4a69-a55f-f1fedfb8d8a0.png)

<div id='AKS'/>  

### **Creation of the AKS Cluster (with SSH keys generated)**

As Kubernetes is totally capable of handling it by itself and more reliably than human hand (with the right settings), I did not create a storage Account, PV creations and bindings.

I created my AKS cluster :

```bash
az aks create -g b8duna -n AKSClusterDuna --enable-managed-identity --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --enable-msi-auth-for-monitoring  --generate-ssh-keys
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='Connecting'/>  

### **Connecting the AKS Cluster and Azure**

Then I connected my AKS cluster to Azure.

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group b8duna --name AKSClusterDuna
```

[&#8679;](#top)

<div id='RedSecret'/>  

### **Issues**

I deployed the azure voting app correctly but had issues once again with ingress and the TLS.
As Quentin, Luna and I, all had the same problems, we realized several tests while streaming our screens.

We tried and discussed our results and failures and finally came to terms.

We found that we needed to :

* create the two namespaces after connecting the AKS cluster to Azure
* create a redis secret for each namespace
* create a helm repository and add nginx to it
* install nginx in each namespace (qua and prod)
* leave some time to nginx to initialize and gets its IP address
* extract the external ip address of the nginx (still in load balancer)
* create a dns record A with nginx external ip address (one for each environment)
* create and add a Hetstack Helm repository to then install cert-manager in the cert-manager namespace
* install cert-manager webhook gandi in the cert-manager namespace
* deploy the voting app in each namespace
* deploy ingress version 1 in each namespace
* deploy let's encrypt issuer configuration files in each namespace
* create a gandi-credentials secret for each namespace (with the dns API token)
* deploy the certificate TLS for each namespace
* finally deploy ingress version 2 in each namespace

After deploying every resource in this order, we could all connect to the voting app from the https urls we chose (for both namespaces).

After all these steps, we decided (with Luna) to create a script that would deploy everything directly without having to redo the steps manually every time our resource groups get destroyed.

<div id='DevOps'/>  

### **Connecting to Azure DevOps Pipelines**

First I went to Azure DevOps, created a project and clicked on Pipelines : <https://dev.azure.com/dlerouxext/b8duna> 

Then, I had to configure my organization and project's [visibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/make-project-public?view=azure-devops). I went to the settings and turned on the visibility to public.

Since the last update of Kubernetes, the connection to Azure can't be made with the service connections.  
Therefore, I had to create a kubeconfig file that recovers several connections informations.

```Bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $rgname --name $aksname -f kubeconfig.yaml
```

then I had to download it and place it directly in my Git repository (downloading it from azure terminal does not push it into Git):

```Bash
download kubeconfig.yaml
```

Once downloaded, I just have to put the code into the pipeline :

![kubeconfig_pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/222142716-c7971b42-d8ea-4116-b7b2-134ea79157da.png)

<div id='Ingress'/>  

### **Deployment of Ingress**

Once I deployed redis and the azure voting app and checked that my pods were running properly I decided to install Ingress to be able to access to the voting app from an url http I chose (and that i would later link to my dns record).

First I installed everything that was necessary for ingress with the following command :

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

Then I created three different versions of Ingress.

* ingress_step1.yaml file  : the TLS parts, the host and the TLS annotations are commented. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

![first_ingress_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/221797099-15cb98e4-40ef-4fa2-b95b-b41ffc3f1d12.png)

After this step, ingress had an IP address. Then I created a "A" DNS record with the ingress IP address. I checked ingress and it now displayed with : smoothie.simplon-duna.space.

* ingress_step2.yaml file  : i added the dns to the host part. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.
* ingress_step3.yaml file  : the TLS parts and the TLS annotations are decommented and the host has its dns name added. I applied it with ```kubectl apply -f ingress_step1.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

Finally I connected to the Voting app using smoothie.simplon-duna.space and it worked.
